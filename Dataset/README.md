# India Power Grid — NLDC Daily PSP Reports

**Structured, analysis-ready data scraped from the National Load Despatch Centre's (NLDC) daily Power System Position (PSP) reports — updated automatically every day.**

Covers the Indian national grid from 2018 onward across three complementary datasets: daily grid features, hourly regional load, and 15-minute SCADA frequency data.

## Source

All data is scraped from the **NLDC (National Load Despatch Centre) / Grid-India** daily PSP reports, published at [grid-india.in](https://grid-india.in/en/reports/daily-psp-report).

Reports are published in PDF format (up to ~2023) and XLS format (2023 onward). Each report covers the previous calendar day.

## Dataset Descriptions

### study1_daily.csv — Daily Grid Features

One row per calendar day. Built from the MOP_E sheet (XLS era) and equivalent PDF sections. Covers generation mix, regional demand, outages, inter-regional flows, cross-border exchange, and frequency statistics.

**Key column groups:**

| Group | Example columns | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Peak demand met | `peak_demand_met_total_mw`, `peak_demand_met_nr_mw`, `..._wr_`, `..._sr_`, `..._er_`, `..._ner_` | Per region + national |
| Energy met & shortage | `energy_met_total_mu`, `energy_shortage_total_mu` | Daily MU |
| Generation mix | `gen_coal_mu`, `gen_hydro_mu`, `gen_nuclear_mu`, `gen_res_mu`, `gen_gas_mu`, `gen_lignite_mu`, `gen_total_mu` | |
| Outages | `outage_central_total_mw`, `outage_state_total_mw`, `outage_total_total_mw` | Per region × central/state |
| Frequency | `freq_fvi`, `freq_pct_below_497`, `freq_pct_497_498`, `freq_pct_498_499`, `freq_pct_499_5005`, `freq_pct_above_5005` | Daily frequency band distribution |
| IR-Line corridors | `ir_wr_nr_export_mu`, `ir_wr_nr_import_mu`, `ir_wr_nr_net_mu` (× 7 region pairs) | 21 cols; available ~2023 onward |
| Cross-border exchange | `xb_export_bhutan_mu`, `xb_import_nepal_mu`, `xb_net_bangladesh_mu` (× 4 countries) | 12 cols; available ~2023 onward |
| RES share | `share_res_pct`, `share_nonfossil_pct` | |
| Diversity factor | `diversity_regional`, `diversity_state` | |

Columns that start appearing only after a certain year (IR-line, cross-border, solar breakdown) are `NaN` before their schema onset date — these are not parse failures, simply sections that did not exist in earlier reports.

### study1_hourly.csv — Hourly Regional Load

One row per hour. Built by left-joining `study1_daily` features onto the [India Hourly Load dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india) (Kaggle). The hourly load source ends April 2024, so this file has a fixed end date.

**Extra columns vs study1_daily:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `datetime` | Hourly timestamp (UTC+5:30 implied) |
| `National Hourly Demand` | MW |
| `Northern Region Hourly Demand` | MW |
| `Western Region Hourly Demand` | MW |
| `Eastern Region Hourly Demand` | MW |
| `Southern Region Hourly Demand` | MW |
| `North-Eastern Region Hourly Demand` | MW |

All 144 daily PSP feature columns are broadcast (repeated) across the 24 hourly rows of each day. Rows where no PSP file exists for that day have `NaN` on all PSP columns (~3.6% of rows).

---

### study2_scada.csv — 15-Minute SCADA Frequency Data

One row per 15-minute block (96 per day). Built from the `TimeSeries` sheet in NLDC XLS files, available from November 2024 onward. Daily MOP_E, IR-Line, and CrossBorder features are broadcast onto each 15-minute row.

**Key column groups:**

| Group | Example columns |
|-------|----------------|
| Timestamp | `date`, `time`, `hhmm` |
| Real-time generation | `nuclear_mw`, `wind_mw`, `solar_mw`, `hydro_mw`, `gas_mw`, `thermal_mw`, `total_gen_mw` |
| Demand | `demand_met_mw`, `net_demand_met_mw` |
| Net transmission | `net_trans_exchange_mw` |
| Frequency | `freq_hz`, `freq_fvi`, `freq_pct_below_497`, `freq_pct_497_498`, `freq_pct_499_5005`, `freq_pct_above_5005` |
| Evening peak demand | `evening_peak_demand_nr_mw`, `..._wr_`, `..._sr_`, `..._er_`, `..._ner_` |
| IR-Line + CrossBorder | Same 21 + 12 cols as study1_daily, broadcast per slot |

## Known Gaps & Limitations

**study1_daily / study1_hourly — 70 missing dates (all irreducible):**

| Cause | Count |
|-------|-------|
| NLDC published duplicate-date reports (next date gets no coverage) | 57 |
| File confirmed unavailable from NLDC server (public holidays) | 20 |
| Edge cases (first date, server downtime) | 3 |

Missing dates are concentrated in 2020 (COVID-era publishing irregularities). These are source-level absences — not parse failures. Recommend forward-fill or time-series-aware imputation.

**study2_scada — slot irregularities:**

A small number of days have 95 or 98 slots instead of 96 (DST / file-truncation edge cases). One day (2025-10-02) has 63 slots and should be dropped before training.

**IR-Line and CrossBorder columns** are `NaN` before ~2023 — these sections were not published in earlier reports.

---

## Update Schedule

`study1_daily` and `study2_scada` are updated automatically every day via GitHub Actions. The workflow downloads the latest PSP file from grid-india.in, parses it, appends new rows, and pushes here.

`study1_hourly` has a fixed end date of April 2024 (the hourly load source dataset is not live).

## Suggested Use Cases

- **Daily load forecasting** — predict next-day peak demand or energy met using generation mix, outage, IR-line, and cross-border features
- **Frequency violation classification** — classify 15-minute blocks by whether a frequency violation occurred, using real-time SCADA features from study2_scada
- **Grid stress analysis** — study the relationship between outages, inter-regional flows, and demand shortages
- **Renewable integration analysis** — track RES share growth and its correlation with frequency deviation over time
- **Cross-border power flow modelling** — analyse India's energy exchange with Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar
